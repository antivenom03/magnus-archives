<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Clarence Berry</a> given Nov 6, 1922 regarding his time serving with <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Willfred Owen</a> in the Great War   </p>
<p>clarence had a succesful run through the majority of the war   </p>
<p>willfred served only for a year, but knew it better than anyone else   </p>
<p>clarence mentions <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">the Piper</a>   </p>
<p>willfred joined july, 1916   </p>
<p>willfred outranked clarence and was not liked as he was somewhat self-absorbed   </p>
<p>over a year, they grew closer   </p>
<p>willfred wrote poetry, which clarence considered terrible   </p>
<p>he would often stop midsentence as if listening for something   </p>
<p>they were ordered to attack the hindenburg line in the spring   </p>
<p>they approach a dangerous area and a quiet falls on the group   </p>
<p>willfred stayed silent as they others screamed and avoided artillery   </p>
<p>clarence snags his leg in barbed wire, and scratches his hand   </p>
<p>looking for help, he sees willfred swaying to a tune   </p>
<p>clarence then heard the sad, fearful pipes   </p>
<p>willfred was suddenly obliterated by mortar fire   </p>
<p>clarence sat until night and crawled back to base   </p>
<p>he was bandadged and found that willfred had not returned   </p>
<p>roughly a week and a half later, they found willfred, burned and wounded but alive   </p>
<p>the shell hole he was laying in was not his own   </p>
<p>the doctor claimed he was completely unharmed, but suffered shellshock and muteness   </p>
<p>in the sick bay, willfred sat and watched a sick man die   </p>
<p>he sat silently as clarence talked him   </p>
<p>he turns to clarence and says that he had "met the war"   </p>
<p>clarence realized he did not mean his touch with death   </p>
<p>willfred claimed the war was no taller than clarence   </p>
<p>clarence asked what it looked like, thinking it was a mirage   </p>
<p>he said it had three faces   </p>
<p>one to play its pipes of bone   </p>
<p>one to scream its battlecry   </p>
<p>and one the held its mouth closed as it spilled blood and soil   </p>
<p>it arms played the pipes, held weapons, and shook its hands in salute or mercy   </p>
<p>it wore a green and black wool coat   </p>
<p>underneath was a mutilated body   </p>
<p>clarence was confused   </p>
<p>willfred was claimed by the piper   </p>
<p>he begged to stay   </p>
<p>it gave him a pen   </p>
<p>it would return someday   </p>
<p>clarence left and willfred was sent to recover in <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">London</a>   </p>
<p>no pen was found with willfred, but the crater he laid in had the remains of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Joseph Rainer</a>   </p>
<p>as time went on, clarence noticed more and more his crewmates seeming distant and listening   </p>
<p>he struggled to find more info on the piper   </p>
<p>willfred's poetry went on to gain a sadness, and a popularity   </p>
<p>in July 1918 Willfred he seemed recovered, though quiet and fearful   </p>
<p>on October 1st, they stormed Joncourt and the weather was beatiful   </p>
<p>Willfred seemed to fight savagely, like a monster and won the military cross   </p>
<p>a month later, he was staring at clarence in his bed at night and said "almost over now, Clarence"   </p>
<p>Clarence did not understand   </p>
<p>willfred was crying   </p>
<p>he heard the piper, and clarence did not   </p>
<p>willfred died two days later in a an attack   </p>
<p>willfred smiled as he bled from a hole in his forehead   </p>
<p>it seemed not like a bullethole, but a orifice   </p>
<p>it seemed to clarence that willfred's death ensured peace   </p>
<p>years later clarence still thinks of it   </p>
