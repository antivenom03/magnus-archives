<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">timothy hodge</a> given dec 9, 2014 regarding a sexual experience with and the death of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">harriet lee</a>   </p>
<p>timothy is a designer who mostly stays at home   </p>
<p>he claims to be sober for the experience in question   </p>
<p>he goes clubbing in <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">brixton</a>   </p>
<p>he sees an attractive woman who seems nervous   </p>
<p>she moved to him and they danced   </p>
<p>she didn't drink, she invited him to spend the night   </p>
<p>she introduces herself, and they go to timothy's home   </p>
<p>she help him, and seemed even more nervous   </p>
<p>she began scratching her arms, leaving wounds   </p>
<p>she relaxed as they got inside   </p>
<p>she continued to ask for only water   </p>
<p>she was a student   </p>
<p>it was clear somthing was wrong   </p>
<p>she said she was mugged, but seemed confused   </p>
<p>she lived on <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">elthorn rd.</a>   </p>
<p>she saw a woman in a strange, shifting dress facedown on the pavement   </p>
<p>as she approached the dress stopped moving   </p>
<p>the woman lunged at her and growled   </p>
<p>she was stabbed   </p>
<p>she woke without a trace of stab wound   </p>
<p>she continued to see the woman everywhere and it made her anxious and itchy   </p>
<p>she got sick approaching the police and could not   </p>
<p>the hospital said nothing was wrong   </p>
<p>she stayed near large groups of peaople for safety   </p>
<p>after telling the story, harriet was visibly upset   </p>
<p>she kisses timothy unexpectedly   </p>
<p>she insisted on having sex   </p>
<p>after, something began moving and squirming under her skin   </p>
<p>she suddenly doubled over in pain   </p>
<p>timothy panics and decides to call an ambulance   </p>
<p>before he could, he heard a wet crack, and harriet became quiet   </p>
<p>he stops at the threshold of the door and looked into the dark room   </p>
<p>he sets his apartment on fire   </p>
<p>he says the room was covered in a dark goo and worms carpeted every surface   </p>
<p>there was no sign of arson or human remains in the fire   </p>
<p>harriet had been reported missing   </p>
<p>it appears like harriet had an encounter with <a href="/magnus-archives/Characters/Jane%20Prentis.html">Jane Prentis</a>   </p>
<p>timothy could not be found for a followup</p></div>
