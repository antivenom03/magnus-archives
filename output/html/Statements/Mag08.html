<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Ivo Lensik</a> given March 13, 2007 regarding experiences while constructing a house on <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Hilltop Rd., Oxford</a>   </p>
<p>Ivo works in construction   </p>
<p>called in mid-job to cover someone    </p>
<p>works another job in mornings, covers in evenings   </p>
<p>There was a large, dead tree in the garden   </p>
<p>it was ominous and casting dark shadows    </p>
<p>someone knocked on the door   </p>
<p>the door was not locked so it must be a stragner   </p>
<p>an average man in a vintage looking coat was there   </p>
<p>he said his name was <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Raymon Fielding</a> and he claimed to own the house   </p>
<p>he had the deed   </p>
<p>he ignored Ivo and stared out the window at the garden   </p>
<p>Ivo began to smell burning hair   </p>
<p>Raymond was gone, and a burn mark was left where he stood   </p>
<p>Ivo worried of schizophrenia as there is a family history   </p>
<p>Ivo's father pulled away from the family due to it   </p>
<p>he was obsessed with the "truth" of fractals   </p>
<p>he feared someone was after him   </p>
<p>he said Ivo would know the man because "all the bones are in his hands"   </p>
<p>he refused to take medication   </p>
<p>Ivo's father had covered his study in fractals and had supposedly committed suicide   </p>
<p>Lost in thought, Ivo trips, hits his head, and passes out   </p>
<p>he is bleeding from the head and called an abulance that took him to a hospital   </p>
<p>he was kept overnight for the concussion   </p>
<p>the doctor said schizophrenia was unliely so suddenly   </p>
<p>A nurse seemed interested in his story   </p>
<p>she asked about Raymond   </p>
<p>she said she lived near there in the 60's and the house was owned by Raymond   </p>
<p>he used it as a halfway house for young people in need of help   </p>
<p>Raymond was well loved, but the young people had a reputation for being roudy   </p>
<p>At some point, a young girl named Agnes moved in   </p>
<p>she was quiet, and some thought she was Raymond's daughter   </p>
<p>Over the years, the people of the house were seen less and less   </p>
<p>Raymond said that they had moved on   </p>
<p>Only Agnes and Raymond were left   </p>
<p>Raymond dissapeared and Agnes had the deed to the house   </p>
<p>she said Raymond had "gone away" and the law found no issue   </p>
<p>Agnes stayed in the house for years, watching from the windows   </p>
<p>there was also a tendency for pets to dissapear in the area   </p>
<p>In 1974 a 5 year old named <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Henry White</a> went missing and no evidence was found   </p>
<p>people blamed agnes and no one helped when her house burned a week later   </p>
<p>No sign of life was found except that of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Raymon Fielding</a>   </p>
<p>The nurse asked him not to speak of it   </p>
<p>Ivo soon goes back to work   </p>
<p>He only worked in daylight and tried to work only with others   </p>
<p>he kept getting signs when he was alone   </p>
<p>at one point he found himself suddenly alone and in the building at dark   </p>
<p>He was radiating with an unnatural internal heat   </p>
<p>he could not breath or move   </p>
<p>the feeling dissapeared as there was a knock on the door   </p>
<p>A catholic priest was at the door   </p>
<p>his name was <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Father Edwin Barrows</a>   </p>
<p>the nurse, name Annie invited him there   </p>
<p>he was an exorcist   </p>
<p>He blessed the house   </p>
<p>Ivo sat in the backyard near the tree   </p>
<p>he became suddenly angry and took a crowbar to it   </p>
<p>the tree bled   </p>
<p>the tree was scorched at the roots   </p>
<p>Ivo used a chain and his car to pull the car out of the ground   </p>
<p>in the hole where it was there was a small, ornate wooden box   </p>
<p>inside was a fresh, green apple   </p>
<p>as Ivo touched it, it rotted and split   </p>
<p>spiders came from it and it turned to dust as it hit the ground   </p>
<p>Ivo smashed the box   </p>
<p>the exorcist left, and all was well as Ivo finished his job   </p>
<p><a href="/magnus-archives/Characters/Jonathan%20Sims.html">Jonathan Sims</a> mentions <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">105 Hilltop Rd., Oxford</a>, giving the numbers which were not in the statement and establishing that it has a history   </p>
<p>barrows has another statement of the event, yet to be located   </p>
<p>the nurse had no extra information   </p>
<p>there is no proof that Agnes existed   </p>
<p>there was a report that an <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Agnes Montegue</a> had died of suicide in her apartment the night the tree was uprooted, though her age did not match up   </p>
<p>a severed human hand was tid to her waist   </p>
<p>this appeared to be the hand missing from Raymond's body when his corpse was found in the fire   </p>
<p>nothing further has happened since this event</p></div>
