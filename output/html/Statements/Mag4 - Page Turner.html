<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Dominic Swain</a> given june 28th, 2013 regarding a book briefly in his possession   </p>
<p>dominic works as a theatre worker, primarily handling lights   </p>
<p>while waiting at <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Notting Hill Gate</a> for a show, he decides to visit a charity shop   </p>
<p>there he finds an old book bound in leather, titled <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Ex Altiora</a> from the library of <a href="/magnus-archives/Characters/jorgen%20lightener.html">jorgen lightener</a>    </p>
<p>it was filled with images of cliffs and heights that induce vertigo   </p>
<p>he buys it as he thinks it is worth more than the shop was charging   </p>
<p>he had somehow spent an hour in the shop, almost making him late   </p>
<p>during the show he thought he smelled ozone coming from a broken light   </p>
<p>he returned late after a drink and decides to look at the book again   </p>
<p>online searches for the book or <a href="/magnus-archives/Characters/jorgen%20lightener.html">jorgen lightener</a> show nothing other than a closed auction   </p>
<p>professionals did not recognize it and put it at about 100 years old   </p>
<p>dominic was able to get some information on jorgen lightener   </p>
<p>given his information, dominic walks for a long time, eventually ending up at <a href="/magnus-archives/Organizations/pinhole%20books.html">pinhole books</a>   </p>
<p><a href="/magnus-archives/Characters/Mary%20Key.html">Mary Key</a> answers the door and seems interested in the book   </p>
<p>she takes him to a strange backroom   </p>
<p>he sees a captivating painting of an eye   </p>
<p>mary gives him bad, old tea without request   </p>
<p>she shows him a book like his, with no title   </p>
<p>upon holding the book in the shadows, small, mishapen bones fell to the floor   </p>
<p>Ex Altiora seems to have changed   </p>
<p>feeling sick, Dominic left as quickly as possible   </p>
<p>Dominic reveals that his friend, <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Michael Crew</a> was struck by lightening as a child because dominic did not want to go inside in a storm   </p>
<p>Someone knocks at Dominic's door   </p>
<p><a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Jared Key</a> is at the door and asks to look at the book, then offers to buy it   </p>
<p>Jared leaves to get the money   </p>
<p>Dominic does research on the two, discovering that Mary Key was dead   </p>
<p>Jared was put on trial for the murder and was aquitted   </p>
<p>Jared returns, gives Dominic the money, burns the book, and leaves   </p>
<p>It appears Gertrude had not organized the archive at all   </p>
<p>the title Ex Altiora cannot be found by the institute</p></div>
