<p>Jonathan Sims: <br />
Statement of Amy Patel, regarding the alleged disappearance of her acquaintance Graham Folger. Original statement given July 1st 2007. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.   </p>
<h2 id="statement-begins">Statement Begins</h2>
<p>Amy Patel, read by Jonathan Sims:   </p>
<p>I first met Graham two years ago, more or less. Itâ€™s hard to say exactly when we first met or even started talking, as we were taking a class together at the time. Iâ€™m sure there was plenty of discussion or interaction before we learned each otherâ€™s names, but I started my course in September of 2005, so yeah, about two years.    </p>
<p>I had decided to take a Criminology course at Birkbeck University as a way of getting out of the rut with my office job â€“ Iâ€™m an Associate Compliance Analyst at Deloitte, and if you think that sounds boring, wellâ€¦ yeah. It is.   </p>
<p>I knew a night course in Criminology wasnâ€™t going to go anywhere, of course, even if Iâ€™d finished it. I just had to do something to find a bit of interest in my life, and it was either that or become an alcoholic, soâ€¦ Sorry, Iâ€™m going off topic.    </p>
<p>I initially found Graham a bit off-putting, to be honest. He was a chain smoker and wore far too much deodorant to try and cover the smell. He was a bit older than me, maybe ten years or so. I never asked his age, I mean, we werenâ€™t that close, but he was starting to grey at the edges of his hair, and you could see that the tiredness on his face wasnâ€™t just from missing a single nightâ€™s sleep. Thatâ€™s not to say he was bad looking â€“ he had a round, open sort of face and quite deep blue eyes, but very much not my type.    </p>
<p>He was well-spoken in group work, at least when he did speak, and I think it came up once that heâ€™d been to Oxford, though I donâ€™t know what college.    </p>
<p>Iâ€™d noticed earlier that during lectures he always seemed to be scribbling furiously in a notebook even when the lecturer wasnâ€™t speaking.   </p>
<p>At first I just thought he was thorough, but I swear I watched him fill a whole A5 notebook in one lecture. I remember it was a talk on youth and the justice system where the speaker was so slow that it wouldnâ€™t have filled that book even if Graham had been writing down literally every word. Not to mention I asked to borrow his notes once for an essay, and he gave me this weird look and said he didnâ€™t take any notes.   </p>
<p>So yeah, point is, I wouldnâ€™t have called him a friend, but we got on alright.   </p>
<p>It was about four months into my course that I first encountered Graham outside of the university. I was riding the night bus home, having gone for a couple of drinks and missed the regular service. I live in Clapham, so thereâ€™s a pretty regular night bus service headed there. Of course, regular also means drunken angry vomiters, so yeah, I generally try to be unobtrusive, sitting in a seat at the back of the top floor.    </p>
<p>It was there that I saw Graham. He was sat right at the front, staring out of the window. People-watching is one of my guilty pleasures, so I decided not to say hello, at least not right away. I wasnâ€™t disappointed, either â€“ he was stranger alone than he had ever been during class.   </p>
<p>It was the middle of winter at this point, so the windows were solid with condensation, but he almost obsessively wiped it away from the one in front of him the moment it started to obscure his view. He seemed to be intently scanning the street for something, except that at times he would crane his neck to stare at the roofs of the buildings passing by. He seemed nervous, as well, and was breathing way faster than normal, which fogged up his window even more. It was slightly alarming to watch, to be honest, and I finally made up my mind to tell him I was there. He jumped a bit when I greeted him, and I asked him if he was alright. He told me he didnâ€™t usually stay out so late and found night time public transport unsettling. I sat next to him, and he seemed to get much more relaxed, so I didnâ€™t push the issue. We talked for a while about nothing in particular, until the bus started to approach my stop. As I rose, I noticed that Graham had stood up at the exact same time as I had, and I realised with some discomfort that we must live at the same stop. I liked the guy fine, donâ€™t get me wrong, but I still didnâ€™t really feel ok with himknowing where I lived. But yeah, it was obvious that Iâ€™d gotten up to get off the bus, so I couldnâ€™t really ride on to the next stop, and it wasnâ€™t even that I felt unsafe with Graham, Iâ€™m just a private person. I decided to just walk back with him as far as necessary and make sure he didnâ€™t see what building I went into. Maybe we werenâ€™t even walking in the same direction. Yeah, we were walking in exactly the same direction. We even seemed to be heading to the same street.It was at that point I felt a hand grab my shoulder and throw me into the road. I donâ€™t know how else to describe it, one moment I was walking along, the next I was flying towards the ground. It canâ€™t have been Graham â€“ he was in front of me at the time, and I would have sworn there was nobody else on the street. There werenâ€™t any cars coming, but I hit my head hard. I think I must have been unconscious for a few seconds, because the next thing I remember is a panicky Graham on the phone to an ambulance. I tried to tell him I was alright, but didnâ€™t really manage to get the words out, which, yeah, probably meant I wasnâ€™t alright. The ambulance arrived in pretty good time, considering it was London on a Friday night, and the paramedics gave me a look over. I was told that the injury itself wasnâ€™t serious â€“ apparently head wounds always bleed that much and itâ€™s nothing to panic about â€“ but that I did have quite a nasty concussion and shouldnâ€™t be left alone for the next few hours. Even though we were within sight of my door, I had for some reason settled upon the idea of Graham never knowing where I lived. In retrospect this was likely the concussion talking, but the upshot was I agreed to go back to Grahamâ€™s flat to recover. He was quite awkward about the whole thing, and took great pains to assure me that there was nothing untoward about the situation; apparently he was gay, which Iâ€™ll admit did actually reassure me a bit. Still, it was clear this wasnâ€™t how either of us had hoped to be ending our nights.   </p>
