[Jonathan Sims](../Characters/Jonathan%20Sims.md):   
Test… Test… Test… 1, 2, 3... Right.    
   
_Jonathan clears their throat_   
   
My name is [Jonathan Sims](../Characters/Jonathan%20Sims.md). I work for [the Magnus Institute](../Organizations/the%20magnus%20institute.md), London, an    
organisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the    
paranormal.   
   
The head of the Institute, Mr [Elias Bouchard](../Characters/Elias%20Bouchard.md), has employed me to replace the    
previous Head Archivist, one [Gertrude Robinson](../Characters/Gertrude%20Robinson.md), who has recently passed    
away.
