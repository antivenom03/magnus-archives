statement of [Clarence Berry](/not_created.md) given Nov 6, 1922 regarding his time serving with [Willfred Owen](/not_created.md) in the Great War   
   
clarence had a succesful run through the majority of the war   
   
willfred served only for a year, but knew it better than anyone else   
   
clarence mentions [the Piper](/not_created.md)   
   
willfred joined july, 1916   
   
willfred outranked clarence and was not liked as he was somewhat self-absorbed   
   
over a year, they grew closer   
   
willfred wrote poetry, which clarence considered terrible   
   
he would often stop midsentence as if listening for something   
   
they were ordered to attack the hindenburg line in the spring   
   
they approach a dangerous area and a quiet falls on the group   
   
willfred stayed silent as they others screamed and avoided artillery   
   
clarence snags his leg in barbed wire, and scratches his hand   
   
looking for help, he sees willfred swaying to a tune   
   
clarence then heard the sad, fearful pipes   
   
willfred was suddenly obliterated by mortar fire   
   
clarence sat until night and crawled back to base   
   
he was bandadged and found that willfred had not returned   
   
roughly a week and a half later, they found willfred, burned and wounded but alive   
   
the shell hole he was laying in was not his own   
   
the doctor claimed he was completely unharmed, but suffered shellshock and muteness   
   
in the sick bay, willfred sat and watched a sick man die   
   
he sat silently as clarence talked him   
   
he turns to clarence and says that he had "met the war"   
   
clarence realized he did not mean his touch with death   
   
willfred claimed the war was no taller than clarence   
   
clarence asked what it looked like, thinking it was a mirage   
   
he said it had three faces   
   
one to play its pipes of bone   
   
one to scream its battlecry   
   
and one the held its mouth closed as it spilled blood and soil   
   
it arms played the pipes, held weapons, and shook its hands in salute or mercy   
   
it wore a green and black wool coat   
   
underneath was a mutilated body   
   
clarence was confused   
   
willfred was claimed by the piper   
   
he begged to stay   
   
it gave him a pen   
   
it would return someday   
   
clarence left and willfred was sent to recover in [London](/not_created.md)   
   
no pen was found with willfred, but the crater he laid in had the remains of [Joseph Rainer](/not_created.md)   
   
as time went on, clarence noticed more and more his crewmates seeming distant and listening   
   
he struggled to find more info on the piper   
   
willfred's poetry went on to gain a sadness, and a popularity   
   
in July 1918 Willfred he seemed recovered, though quiet and fearful   
   
on October 1st, they stormed Joncourt and the weather was beatiful   
   
Willfred seemed to fight savagely, like a monster and won the military cross   
   
a month later, he was staring at clarence in his bed at night and said "almost over now, Clarence"   
   
Clarence did not understand   
   
willfred was crying   
   
he heard the piper, and clarence did not   
   
willfred died two days later in a an attack   
   
willfred smiled as he bled from a hole in his forehead   
   
it seemed not like a bullethole, but a orifice   
   
it seemed to clarence that willfred's death ensured peace   
   
years later clarence still thinks of it
