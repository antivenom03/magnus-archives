statement of [Kieran Woodward](/not_created.md) given feb 23, 2009 regarding trash found at [93 Lancaster RD., Walthamstowe](/not_created.md)    
   
Kieran is a bin man   
   
this occured last year (2008)   
   
They note that they are extra aware of the things that are thrown away and forgotten   
   
First was a bag of doll heads with a slight rip, it was full, approx. 100   
   
they were battered and each unique   
   
They mention [David Atayah](/not_created.md), [Mattew Wilkinson](/not_created.md), and [Allen parfitt](/not_created.md)   
   
they laughed it off   
   
the next few trips found nothing interesting   
   
In spring, they found another bag   
   
It seemed to be full of paper   
   
they open it   
   
it was a single, long strip of inch wide paper   
   
latin, supposedly the lord's prayer was written on it   
   
it seemed burned at points   
   
they threw it in and moved on   
   
a fortnite later they found a third bag   
   
it was heavy   
   
the bag hit something and burst   
   
it was full of teeth, seemingly human   
   
they were exteremely disturbed   
   
they called the police   
   
an old woman answered the door   
   
the old couple had no idea and were also observed   
   
no info was given to the binmen   
   
nothing more was found for a while   
   
Allen soon became unwell and confrontational   
   
he revealed he had been watching the house at night   
   
he seemed not to listen to responses   
   
Allen continued to worsen, eventually losing his job   
   
[guy wardman](/not_created.md) replaced [Allen parfitt](/not_created.md)   
   
Allen texts kieran "found him" and suddenly dissapears   
   
kieran goes to the house to find nothing other than a black bag with a green ribbon   
   
they open the bag to find packing peanuts and a fist-sized lump of metal   
   
it was a cold, anatomical heart engraved with the name [Allen parfitt](/not_created.md)   
   
it was incinerated   
   
the events were corroborated by the other witnesses   
   
further interviews have shown nothing   
   
allen was reported missing and not found   
   
no suspect was found   
   
the teeth were human, and all 2780 were the same tooth
