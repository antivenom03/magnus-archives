statement of [Ivo Lensik](/not_created.md) given March 13, 2007 regarding experiences while constructing a house on [Hilltop Rd., Oxford](/not_created.md)   
   
Ivo works in construction   
   
called in mid-job to cover someone    
   
works another job in mornings, covers in evenings   
   
There was a large, dead tree in the garden   
   
it was ominous and casting dark shadows    
   
someone knocked on the door   
   
the door was not locked so it must be a stragner   
   
an average man in a vintage looking coat was there   
   
he said his name was [Raymon Fielding](/not_created.md) and he claimed to own the house   
   
he had the deed   
   
he ignored Ivo and stared out the window at the garden   
   
Ivo began to smell burning hair   
   
Raymond was gone, and a burn mark was left where he stood   
   
Ivo worried of schizophrenia as there is a family history   
   
Ivo's father pulled away from the family due to it   
   
he was obsessed with the "truth" of fractals   
   
he feared someone was after him   
   
he said Ivo would know the man because "all the bones are in his hands"   
   
he refused to take medication   
   
Ivo's father had covered his study in fractals and had supposedly committed suicide   
   
Lost in thought, Ivo trips, hits his head, and passes out   
   
he is bleeding from the head and called an abulance that took him to a hospital   
   
he was kept overnight for the concussion   
   
the doctor said schizophrenia was unliely so suddenly   
   
A nurse seemed interested in his story   
   
she asked about Raymond   
   
she said she lived near there in the 60's and the house was owned by Raymond   
   
he used it as a halfway house for young people in need of help   
   
Raymond was well loved, but the young people had a reputation for being roudy   
   
At some point, a young girl named Agnes moved in   
   
she was quiet, and some thought she was Raymond's daughter   
   
Over the years, the people of the house were seen less and less   
   
Raymond said that they had moved on   
   
Only Agnes and Raymond were left   
   
Raymond dissapeared and Agnes had the deed to the house   
   
she said Raymond had "gone away" and the law found no issue   
   
Agnes stayed in the house for years, watching from the windows   
   
there was also a tendency for pets to dissapear in the area   
   
In 1974 a 5 year old named [Henry White](/not_created.md) went missing and no evidence was found   
   
people blamed agnes and no one helped when her house burned a week later   
   
No sign of life was found except that of [Raymon Fielding](/not_created.md)   
   
The nurse asked him not to speak of it   
   
Ivo soon goes back to work   
   
He only worked in daylight and tried to work only with others   
   
he kept getting signs when he was alone   
   
at one point he found himself suddenly alone and in the building at dark   
   
He was radiating with an unnatural internal heat   
   
he could not breath or move   
   
the feeling dissapeared as there was a knock on the door   
   
A catholic priest was at the door   
   
his name was [Father Edwin Barrows](/not_created.md)   
   
the nurse, name Annie invited him there   
   
he was an exorcist   
   
He blessed the house   
   
Ivo sat in the backyard near the tree   
   
he became suddenly angry and took a crowbar to it   
   
the tree bled   
   
the tree was scorched at the roots   
   
Ivo used a chain and his car to pull the car out of the ground   
   
in the hole where it was there was a small, ornate wooden box   
   
inside was a fresh, green apple   
   
as Ivo touched it, it rotted and split   
   
spiders came from it and it turned to dust as it hit the ground   
   
Ivo smashed the box   
   
the exorcist left, and all was well as Ivo finished his job   
   
[Jonathan Sims](../Characters/Jonathan%20Sims.md) mentions [105 Hilltop Rd., Oxford](/not_created.md), giving the numbers which were not in the statement and establishing that it has a history   
   
barrows has another statement of the event, yet to be located   
   
the nurse had no extra information   
   
there is no proof that Agnes existed   
   
there was a report that an [Agnes Montegue](/not_created.md) had died of suicide in her apartment the night the tree was uprooted, though her age did not match up   
   
a severed human hand was tid to her waist   
   
this appeared to be the hand missing from Raymond's body when his corpse was found in the fire   
   
nothing further has happened since this event
