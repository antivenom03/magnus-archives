[[Jonathan Sims]]:
Test… Test… Test… 1, 2, 3... Right. 

_Jonathan clears their throat_

My name is [[Jonathan Sims]]. I work for [[the Magnus Institute]], London, an 
organisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the 
paranormal.

The head of the Institute, Mr [[Elias Bouchard]], has employed me to replace the 
previous Head Archivist, one [[Gertrude Robinson]], who has recently passed 
away.

I have been working as a researcher at the Institute for four years now and am 
familiar with most of our more significant contracts and projects. Most reach 
dead ends, predictably enough, as incidents of the supernatural, such as they 
are, (and I always emphasise there are very few genuine cases) tend to resist 
easy conclusions. 

When an investigation has gone as far as it can, it is transferred to [[the 
Archives]]. 

Now, [[the magnus Institute]] was founded in 1818, which means that [[the Archives]] 
contain almost 200 years of case files at this point.

Combine that with the fact that most of [[the magnus institute|the Institute]] prefers the ivory tower of pure academia to the complicated work of dealing with statements or recent 
experiences and you have the recipe for an impeccably organised library and 
an absolute mess of an archive.
