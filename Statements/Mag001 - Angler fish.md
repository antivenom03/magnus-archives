[[Jonathan Sims]]:
Test… Test… Test… 1, 2, 3... Right. 

_Jonathan clears their throat_

My name is [[Jonathan Sims]]. I work for [[the Magnus Institute]], London, an 
organisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the 
paranormal.

The head of the Institute, Mr [[Elias Bouchard]], has employed me to replace the 
previous Head Archivist, one [[Gertrude Robinson]], who has recently passed 
away.
