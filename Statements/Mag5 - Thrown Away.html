<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Kieran Woodward</a> given feb 23, 2009 regarding trash found at <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">93 Lancaster RD., Walthamstowe</a>    </p>
<p>Kieran is a bin man   </p>
<p>this occured last year (2008)   </p>
<p>They note that they are extra aware of the things that are thrown away and forgotten   </p>
<p>First was a bag of doll heads with a slight rip, it was full, approx. 100   </p>
<p>they were battered and each unique   </p>
<p>They mention <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">David Atayah</a>, <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Mattew Wilkinson</a>, and <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Allen parfitt</a>   </p>
<p>they laughed it off   </p>
<p>the next few trips found nothing interesting   </p>
<p>In spring, they found another bag   </p>
<p>It seemed to be full of paper   </p>
<p>they open it   </p>
<p>it was a single, long strip of inch wide paper   </p>
<p>latin, supposedly the lord's prayer was written on it   </p>
<p>it seemed burned at points   </p>
<p>they threw it in and moved on   </p>
<p>a fortnite later they found a third bag   </p>
<p>it was heavy   </p>
<p>the bag hit something and burst   </p>
<p>it was full of teeth, seemingly human   </p>
<p>they were exteremely disturbed   </p>
<p>they called the police   </p>
<p>an old woman answered the door   </p>
<p>the old couple had no idea and were also observed   </p>
<p>no info was given to the binmen   </p>
<p>nothing more was found for a while   </p>
<p>Allen soon became unwell and confrontational   </p>
<p>he revealed he had been watching the house at night   </p>
<p>he seemed not to listen to responses   </p>
<p>Allen continued to worsen, eventually losing his job   </p>
<p><a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">guy wardman</a> replaced <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Allen parfitt</a>   </p>
<p>Allen texts kieran "found him" and suddenly dissapears   </p>
<p>kieran goes to the house to find nothing other than a black bag with a green ribbon   </p>
<p>they open the bag to find packing peanuts and a fist-sized lump of metal   </p>
<p>it was a cold, anatomical heart engraved with the name <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Allen parfitt</a>   </p>
<p>it was incinerated   </p>
<p>the events were corroborated by the other witnesses   </p>
<p>further interviews have shown nothing   </p>
<p>allen was reported missing and not found   </p>
<p>no suspect was found   </p>
<p>the teeth were human, and all 2780 were the same tooth</p></div>
