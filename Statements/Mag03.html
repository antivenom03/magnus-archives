<div class="content"><p>statement of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Amy Pattel</a> regarding the dissapearance of <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">graham folger</a> given july 1, 2007   </p>
<p>amy met graham in a class roughly two years ago in <a href="/magnus-archives/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">London</a>   </p>
<p>graham chainsmoked, was about 10 years older than amy, and was constantly scribbling in a notebook despite the claim that he does not take notes   </p>
<p>amy sees graham on the bus after a night of drinking, he seemed to be looking for something   </p>
<p>graham lives at the same stop as amy   </p>
<p>amy feels a hand that is not graham behind her that threw her into the road   </p>
<p>amy has a headwound and went to graham's flat to recover   </p>
<p>graham's flat is across from amy's   </p>
<p>amy sees a plant box into the window that isn't there   </p>
<p>amy is enraptured by a strange, antique table that is missing a piece in the center   </p>
<p>Amy sees graham in his flat from her flat and chooses to watch him regularly   </p>
<p>amy observes graham reowriting in, and eating his notebooks   </p>
<p>graham is extremely jumpy, only spending the time smoking and eating   </p>
<p>amy watchees graham after being busy for a while   </p>
<p>she sees an extremely long arm, snaking its way into graham's window   </p>
<p>she calls the police for a breakin at his address   </p>
<p>someone who is not graham answers the door for the police   </p>
<p>they search the apartment, and determine that everything is fine   </p>
<p>the not-graham was staring at amy and she never saw graham again   </p>
<p>not-graham continued to watch amy and disposed of the notebooks   </p>
<p>amy moved away   </p>
<p>amy's medical records do not show history of complications in the brain and would not do a second interview   </p>
<p>graham seems to have been completely replaced by not-graham except through extremely old photos</p></div>
