statement of [[Dominic Swain]] given june 28th, 2013 regarding a book briefly in his possession

dominic works as a theatre worker, primarily handling lights

while waiting at [[Notting Hill Gate]] for a show, he decides to visit a charity shop

there he finds an old book bound in leather, titled [[Ex Altiora]] from the library of [[jorgen lightener]] 

it was filled with images of cliffs and heights that induce vertigo

he buys it as he thinks it is worth more than the shop was charging

he had somehow spent an hour in the shop, almost making him late

during the show he thought he smelled ozone coming from a broken light

he returned late after a drink and decides to look at the book again

online searches for the book or [[jorgen lightener]] show nothing other than a closed auction

professionals did not recognize it and put it at about 100 years old

dominic was able to get some information on jorgen lightener

given his information, dominic walks for a long time, eventually ending up at [[pinhole books]]

[[Mary Key]] answers the door and seems interested in the book

she takes him to a strange backroom

he sees a captivating painting of an eye

mary gives him bad, old tea without request

she shows him a book like his, with no title

upon holding the book in the shadows, small, mishapen bones fell to the floor

Ex Altiora seems to have changed

feeling sick, Dominic left as quickly as possible

Dominic reveals that his friend, [[Michael Crew]] was struck by lightening as a child because dominic did not want to go inside in a storm

Someone knocks at Dominic's door

[[Jared Key]] is at the door and asks to look at the book, then offers to buy it

Jared leaves to get the money

Dominic does research on the two, discovering that Mary Key was dead

Jared was put on trial for the murder and was aquitted

Jared returns, gives Dominic the money, burns the book, and leaves

It appears Gertrude had not organized the archive at all

the title Ex Altiora cannot be found by the institute
